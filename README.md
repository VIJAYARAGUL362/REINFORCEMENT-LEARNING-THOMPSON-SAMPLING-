# Thompson Sampling for Multi-Armed Bandit Problem

This project implements the **Thompson Sampling** algorithm to solve the **Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB)** problem. The goal is to determine the most effective advertisement to show to users in order to maximize the click-through rate (CTR). Thompson Sampling is a probabilistic algorithm that balances exploration and exploitation to identify the best-performing ad.

## Overview
The Multi-Armed Bandit problem is a classic reinforcement learning scenario where an agent must choose between multiple actions (e.g., showing different ads) to maximize cumulative rewards (e.g., clicks). Thompson Sampling is a Bayesian approach that uses probability distributions to balance exploration (trying new ads) and exploitation (selecting the best-known ad).

## Multi-Armed Bandit Problem
In this context:
- **Arms**: Represent different advertisements.
- **Rewards**: Represent user clicks (1 for a click, 0 for no click).
- **Objective**: Maximize the total number of clicks over a series of rounds.

## Thompson Sampling Algorithm
Thompson Sampling works as follows:
1. **Initialization**: Start with a prior belief about the click-through rate (CTR) of each ad using a Beta distribution.
2. **Selection**: For each round, sample a CTR from the Beta distribution for each ad and select the ad with the highest sampled CTR.
3. **Update**: Observe the user's response (click or no click) and update the Beta distribution parameters for the selected ad.
4. **Repeat**: Continue the process for a fixed number of rounds to refine the estimates of each ad's CTR.

## Dataset
The dataset used is `Ads_CTR_Optimisation.csv`, which contains simulated data about ad clicks. Each row represents a user, and each column represents an ad. A value of `1` indicates a click, while `0` indicates no click.

## Code Implementation
The code is implemented in Python and uses the following libraries:
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and random sampling.
- **Pandas**: For loading and processing the dataset.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing the results.

### Key Steps:
1. **Import Libraries**: Import necessary libraries.
2. **Load Dataset**: Load the `Ads_CTR_Optimisation.csv` dataset.
3. **Initialize Parameters**: Set the number of rounds (`N`) and the number of ads (`d`). Initialize reward counters for each ad.
4. **Thompson Sampling Loop**:
   - For each round, sample a CTR from the Beta distribution for each ad.
   - Select the ad with the highest sampled CTR.
   - Simulate showing the ad and observe the reward (click or no click).
   - Update the Beta distribution parameters for the selected ad.
5. **Accumulate Rewards**: Track the total rewards (clicks) over all rounds.
6. **Visualize Results**: Plot a histogram showing the frequency of ad selections.

## Results and Visualization
The results are visualized using a **histogram** that shows how often each ad was selected. This helps identify the best-performing ad (the one selected most frequently).

## Usage
This implementation is useful for:
- **Students**: Learning about Thompson Sampling and the Multi-Armed Bandit problem.
- **Data Scientists**: Exploring reinforcement learning algorithms for decision-making.
- **Marketing Professionals**: Optimizing ad selection to maximize user engagement.

To run the code:
1. Ensure you have Python installed with the required libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib).
2. Download the `Ads_CTR_Optimisation.csv` dataset.
3. Run the code to simulate the Thompson Sampling algorithm and visualize the results.

## Further Applications
- **A/B Testing**: Use Thompson Sampling to dynamically allocate traffic between different website versions.
- **Recommendation Systems**: Optimize recommendations in e-commerce or streaming platforms.
- **Clinical Trials**: Allocate patients to different treatments to maximize effectiveness.

# REINFORCEMENT-LEARNING-THOMPSON-SAMPLING-
This project uses **Thompson Sampling** to solve the **Multi-Armed Bandit problem**, optimizing ad selection to maximize clicks. It balances exploration and exploitation, visualizes results with a histogram, and is ideal for learning reinforcement learning or improving ad strategies.
